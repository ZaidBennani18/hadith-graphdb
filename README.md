# Hadith GraphDB

A Neo4j-based graph database system for analyzing citation networks in classical Arabic Hadith manuscripts. Developed as part of my MSc Computer Science dissertation at Heriot-Watt University.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project models and visualizes Hadith transmission chains using graph theory. It focuses on fast traversal, scalable data processing, and interactive 3D exploration.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔗 **Graph Model**: Over 37,000 nodes and 177,000 relationships modeled from six major Hadith collections.
- ⚡ **Optimized Traversal**: Reduced chain traversal query time to under 2s (compared to 4.2s in traditional RDBMS).
- 🤖 **Data Automation**: Scraped, cleaned, and processed narrations from six major Hadith collections via a custom pipeline.
- 🌐 **3D Visualization**: Implemented interactive 3D network view.
